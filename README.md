Chapter 1 - A problem on earth 2100 AD 

For decades the temperature increased and the polar ice caps melted until the change in climate could no longer be denied.  Research and on GMO's and low water farming and ranching techniques. 

Global Warming 

Melting Polar Ice Caps 

Drought Killing Crops 

Reducing available livable land mass 

Creating new overgrown rainforests 

And new alpha predators 

 

Chapter 2 â€“ A search for a solution 

Building on technologies first introduced by Space X in 2018 colonies on earth and mars are created where advanced subspace communication and low gravity construction and warp field generation research progresses rapidly 

Warp Probes 

Subspace communications 

Orbital Communities 

The Mars Colony 

The Mars option (Terraforming) 

Robot assistants 

Genocide to save food

 

Chapter 3 - Where no man has gone before - The spaceship project 

Building on the advances in orbital construction and robotic assisted surface construction an interstellar FTL warp field spacecraft is constructed in orbit.  Construction time and cost is reduced through the use of space elevator technology. 

Recon / Infrastructure ship with room for 1000 leaves 2 years earlier 

10 more ships room for the 10,000 each 

Built in space due to massive size 

The construction site space station 

Space Elevator to lift parts to space 

Artificial Gravity for passengers 

Zero G storage in central fuselage 

Warp Drive 

 Part 2:
 

Chapter 4 - Crew selection 

The recon and infrastructure team will depart one year before regular citizens.  They setup the subspace communication transmission station in orbit then land and begin construction on the Genesis habitat module and space elevator.  Everyone wants to escape but there are only 10,000 seats per year available on the destiny spacecraft.  1,000 crew and staff are selected for each launch 2 years in advance, the remaining 9,000 are randomly selected by lottery but sorted for equal diversity.  

Need for diversity 

1000 family members including crew for recon ship 

10,000 citizens for each destiny space craft departing every 12 months 

5,000 selected by skills and diversity 

5,000 lottery winners  

Physical and mental health 

Necessary skills 

 

Chapter 5 - The launch 

Crew arrives at space station 3 months before launch 

Zero G launch at impulse 

Engage warp drive 

Faster than light travel 

 

Chapter 6 - Life aboard a space ship 

Low G life 

Food and Nutrition 

Recreation and Entertainment 

Hygiene 
Love and Life 
Malfunction or Sabotage 
Unexpected Loss (Death) 
Religion / Spirituality 

 

Chapter 7 - Alpha Centaury (Or Mars, or Europa) 

The Destination 

How far / How fast 

Navigation 

Slow down 

Orbit 

 

Chapter 8 - The landing 

Landing craft(s) 

Orbiting Spacecraft as space station 

Communication link with earth 

Touchdown location 

Crash Landing (or challenged landing causing damage to lander) 

Surface to orbit communications 

Change in Gravity 

Surface transportation 

Surface communication 

 

Chapter 9 - Indigenous life 

Atmosphere 

Flora and fauna 

Birds and Insects 

Fish and mammals 

Humanoid inhabitants 

Size and strength 

 

Chapter 10 - No way back 

Damage to the Orbiter restricts warp travel 

Scavenged parts restrict high bandwidth long range communications 

Food lost in Orbiter explosion reduces available reserves (introduced in chapter 5) 

 

Chapter 11 - The new pilgrims 

Lack of food 

limited communication with earth 

Struggle to survive 

Housing 

Government 

Food Production 

Power Generation 

Solar power 

Hydro
