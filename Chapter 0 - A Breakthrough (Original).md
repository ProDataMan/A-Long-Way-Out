It was an evening like any other evening in Seattle back in 2015, so in other words, it was a dark and stormy night…  It was in the brief moments before the technological explosion and exponential advancements led by Artificial Intelligence, that a fledgling transportation logistics company sparked to life.  BidLimo began to integrate AI components into the transportation logistics, reservation and scheduling software that it provided to its customers, who were primarily rideshare companies.  I was a developer at the time and thought that there must be a better way to get a ride and not have to walk 5 blocks in the rain with my suitcase, so I started working on a piece of logistics and routing software to solve the problem.  Next thing you know its 2 years later, we have a team of 75 people and every rideshare company runs their reservations on our platform.    

I was just finishing up the last bits of code for the latest updates to the BidLimo.com reservation and logistics systems.  This new update included an Artificial Intelligence component that would be game changing as the state of the art in Artificial Intelligence made it very clear that the singularity was near. 

Advancements in robotics, sensors, computer vision and artificial intelligence had accelerated as the world moved closer to the singularity.  Not familiar with the technological singularity?  This is the point at which technological advancement accelerates to the point that technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence begin to replicate themselves.  It is at this point when machines begin to build an upgrade themselves with the help of artificial intelligence that the complexities and capabilities of these machines begin to far surpass human capabilities and intelligence.  This would become especially true of the AI component that we were adding to the GPS routing and customer mapping services of BidLimo.com.

Just as I checked the code into the source control system the phone rang and scared the shit out me!  It was 1am already who the hell was calling me at that hour.  “Hello” I said in a voice so horse it sounded as if I hadn’t slept in decades. “Victor, we need to talk about this Travel Net deal!”. 

As we were getting closer to releasing the new features of our on-demand travel and ride hailing software we had begun researching strategic partnerships with companies that already had the customers and eyeballs we were looking to acquire Travel Net was on the short list. 

“Come on Mikey I’m right in the middle of something and its 1am for fucks sake!” I said a little more sternly than I meant to. 

“Dude this won’t wait we need to jump on this now!” said Mikey in an excited and frantic tone.  It was unusual for him to call me this late so whatever this is it must be important.  “Travel Nets CEO Patrick Vantrump was just removed from the board as a result of videos surfacing of his, let’s call it unsavory, behavior.” Mikey said in an almost giddy tone.  “Video of Vantrump walking down the row of Miss Texas beauty pageant contests and squeezing their asses’ comments on how soft or firm each was” Mikey said holding back giggles.  This sudden change of events will put Travel Net in the uncomfortable position of having to name a new CEO amidst the swirling rumors about their CEOs illicit behavior as their stock tanks days before the release of their quarterly report. 

This was exactly the type of opportunity we were looking for.  We could probably acquire the company below market value and change the narrative by announcing the new partnership and coming product releases.  We could basically get everything we needed for pennies on the dollar saving us millions in new customer acquisitions. 

I told Mikey to get the team together and prepare and offer and have the team start working a press kit and media package to reset the narrative and I would join them when I was finished with the software update. 

I hung up the phone with Mikey glanced at my screen and noticed that the AI had already begun analyzing the reservation data…  I tried to review the progress data from the log but the analysis was using so much processing power that the system didn’t even respond.  I was about to pull the plug when I noticed that the database had grown in size by 4 terabytes and user location trends and prediction reports began to appear on screen. Location predictions?  The system began adding the location of each customers friends, family, associates and even grocery store clerks and bartenders locations to the map along with their predicted next destination. The AI was not only analyzing customer location data, it was analyzing every location they went and everyone they came into contact with there. Employees currently working at each location along with their home address, bank account information and next of kin / emergency contact details were all readily available online in cloud based HR platforms used by most businesses these days.  So of course all of this information was at the AIs disposal. The reports flashing onscreen included the contact information and an alarming amount of details about each person including confirmation that a promotional email invitation to download the app and get a free ride to their predicted next destination the service had already been sent, received and the app,  had been downloaded  and account activated.  The AI was just supposed to help optimize route pairing by predicting probable destination using “available” information about existing customers origin and destination on past and current trips. The AI seemed to be using the bid limo customer database and the travel net database that we were given a copy of as we began to evaluate the deal. Technically we weren't legally authorized to use it yet although that seemed like a done deal with the new developments Mikey just called to tell me about.  We just need to make sure we close that deal before word of this massive customer expansion gets out. The AI also managed to expand it's search into any customer database that had linked their HR system to travel nets corporate travel API to allow their employees to book their own business travel.  That gave us access to 80% of the people on the planet who travel or are employed.  
I left the AI to its guerrilla marketing campaign as it began offering free rides to every person not already a Bid limo customer in travel nets system or any of the HR systems connected to travel net system on the planet a total of 90 million souls.
The next morning I woke up and told my virtual assistant to tell me what's new today.  Thotiana what's going on today? yeah yeah I know Thotiana isn't the most appropriate name for my virtual assistant but a guy's got to have some fun right I do what I want. Thotiana responded by saying there were 2  bid limo notifications and 1 schedule update.  Thotiana what are the notifications?  Thationa said bid limo update 1:  5 million new customers registered since last update
Thotiana when was the last update?  Thotiana said: Last update at 12:16am today.
Bidlimo update 2: Severe driver shortage.
Shit too many customers not enough drivers. I guess that's a good problem to have. 
Thotiana what are the schedule updates?
 You have a 7:00 a.m. meeting with the travel net board and Patrick Van Trump to discuss the travel net purchase agreement.  
Thotiana what's traveling nets stock price this morning? Travel net is trading at $43 a share down 83% from yesterday
Haha this ought to be interesting can't wait.
I strolled into the boardroom a little more than fashionably late since I wasn't able to get a car from the bid limo network due to the excessive number of new customers and the extreme shortage of drivers available to handle the increased demand. I immediately made eye contact with Van Trump I nodded to him and addressed the board, I expressed my sincere apologies for my tardiness and expressed my desire to grasp this plump opportunity firmly and quickly, in a way that Van Trump will appreciate I'm sure.  Within 30 minutes the deal was done and we had just aquired travel net and the right to "legally" use the customer database which our AI had already raped and pillaged to the night before.

With the acquisition of travel net our reach into customer details including detailed location data increased exponentially.  BidLimo soon takes over the world of transportation logistics I take the company public and pocket 23 billion dollars which I uses to purchase a medium sized airline, Sun Coast Air and, Rocket and Commercial Jet manufacturer, BlackSpace Aeronautics. The advanced research and development division, led by Physicist Dr. Voyce Cornhut had just announced groundbreaking new discoveries on their path to developing antigravity engines.  With the discovery of element 115 long rumored to have mass altering properties and BlackSpaces unique method of generation a magnetic field strong enough to contain and direct the elements energy they we years ahead of the competition in the mass production of antigravity engines.
With the infusion of cash and the silicon valley Agile approach to solution development applied by the BidLimo development team, the antigravity prototype testings was completed in less than a year of the aquisition. Within 3 months of test completion the production line was completed and cracking out 1 new Antigravity engine per hour. With the Travelnet, SunCoast Air and BlackSpace aquisitions Bid Limo rebrands as TransPlanet Air and Space, making trillions selling the engines to other airlines and retrofitting traditional jet planes with the new antigravity Arab engines, and in the process completely changing the air travel and space launch industries forever.

With travel times 1/10th what they were previously and capacity more than doubled due to the elimination of wings, international travel suddenly became very affordable and convenient for all. 

While using the antigravity ARab engines to launch satellites, advances were made in laser inferometer pathfinding and navigation (LIPN) Using the LiPN system new ships will be able to scan a path 5 light years ahead of their current position for obstacles including Stars,  planets, asteroids and other ships on an intercept trejectory
